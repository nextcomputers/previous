 2) About Previous
 -----------------

Previous is a NeXT Computer emulator based on the Atari emulator Hatari. It uses 
the latest m68k emulation core from WinUAE and the i860 emulator from Jason Eckhardt. 
Previous is confirmed to compile and run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It may also 
work on other Systems which are supported by the SDL library, like FreeBSD, NetBSD 
and BeOS.

Previous emulates the following machines:
 NeXT Computer (original 68030 Cube)
 NeXTcube
 NeXTcube Turbo
 NeXTstation
 NeXTstation Turbo
 NeXTstation Color
 NeXTstation Turbo Color
 NeXTdimension Graphics Board


 3) Compiling and installing
 ---------------------------

For using Previous, you need to have installed the following libraries:

Required:
- The SDL library v2.0.5 or later (http://www.libsdl.org)
- The libpng PNG reference library (http://www.libpng.org)
- The zlib compression library (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)


Don't forget to also install the header files of these libraries for compiling
Previous (some Linux distributions use separate development packages for these
header files)!

For compiling Previous, you need a C compiler (preferably GNU C), and a working
CMake installation (see http://www.cmake.org/ for details).

CMake can generate makefiles for various flavors of "Make" (like GNU-Make)
and various IDEs like Xcode on Mac OS X. To run CMake, you've got to pass the
path to the sources of Previous as parameter, for example run the following if
you are in the topmost directory of the Previous source tree:
	cmake .

If you're tracking Previous version control, it's preferable to do
the build in a separate build directory as above would overwrite
the (non-CMake) Makefiles coming with Previous:
	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake ..

Have a look at the manual of CMake for other options. Alternatively, you can
use the "cmake-gui" program to configure the sources with a graphical
application.

After cmake finished the configuration successfully, you can compile Previous
by typing "make". If all works fine, you'll get the executable "Previous" in 
the src/ subdirectory of the build tree.


 4) Status
 ---------

Previous is still work in progress. Some hardware is not yet emulated:
CPU		good (but not cycle-exact)
MMU		good
FPU		good
DSP		good
DMA		good
NextBus		good
Memory		good
2-bit graphics	good
Color graphics	good
RTC		good
Timers		good
SCSI drive	good
MO drive	good (single drive)
Floppy drive	good
Ethernet	good
Serial		dummy
Printer		good
Sound		good
Keyboard	good
Mouse		good
ADB		dummy
Nitro		dummy
Dimension	partial (no video I/O)


There are remaining problems with the host to emulated machine interface for
input devices.


 5) Known issues
 ---------------

- Un-emulated hardware may cause problems in certain situations (see above).
- The MO drive causes problems (mainly hangs) when both drives are used (disabled).
- Variable CPU speed mode does not work if an MO drive is connected.
- DSP sound has timing related issues. DSPmusic under NeXTstep 0.9 sometimes produces 
  bad audio or hangs in variable speed mode. ScorePlayer under NeXTstep 2.x produces 
  distorted sound in normal CPU mode.
- Shortcuts do not work properly or overlap with host commands on some platforms.
- CPU timings are not correct. You may experience performance differences compared 
  to real hardware.
- There is some instability when running Mac OS via Daydream.
- FPU only works on x86 hosts.
- Slirp: In certain rare conditions Slirp may crash.
- Starting sound output or sound input may cause short lags in emulation. This is most
  likely caused by SDL or host audio hardware and drivers.



 6) Release notes
 ----------------

  Previous v1.0:
  > Initial release.

  > Fixes bug in SCSI code. Images greater than 4 GB are now supported.
  > Fixes bug in Real Time Clock. Years after 1999 are now accepted.
  > Fixes bug that prevented screen output on Linux.
  > Fixes bug that caused NeXTdimension to fail after disabling thread.

  Previous v1.6 (unreleased):
  > Fixes bug that prevented NeXTdimension from stopping in rare cases.


 7) Running Previous
 -------------------

For running the emulator, you need an image of the boot ROM of the emulated 
machine.

While the emulator is running, you can open the configuration menu by
pressing F12, toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode by pressing F11 
and initiate a clean shut down by pressing F10 (emulates the power button).
